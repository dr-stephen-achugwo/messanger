## MERN Messanger
This messenger is built using React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Socket.IO. It allows users to create chats and invite friends to join. All members of a chat receive real-time notifications about new messages. If a user hasnâ€™t opened the chat, they can still see the number of unread messages. Message updates are implemented with Socket.IO for seamless real-time communication, while the messages, chats, and user data are securely stored in a MongoDB database.
